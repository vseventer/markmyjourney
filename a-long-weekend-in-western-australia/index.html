<p>Our flight from Melbourne to Perth, the capital of Western Australia, took roughly four hours, and we landed on an early Saturday morning. Coming from Melbourne, Perth seemed a bit less fast-paced. Typically, on Saturday morning, people in Melbourne are out doing their weekend grocery shopping, but in Perth, it was very quiet in the CBD.</p>

<h2 id=perth:83f844163da5d3d70287000a4a71c6cd>Perth</h2>
<p>We started by exploring the Hay Street Mall and the Perth Mint in the CBD. From there, we crossed the Horseshoe Bridge towards the Northbridge neighborhood. This is an exciting area in Perth, lined with various bars and restaurants. On our way to Northbridge we came across a couple parks with big screens playing anything from sports to art themed films. We recommend to just grab an ice cream and enjoy the various green spaces. The highlight arguably, however is the view from Kings Park. You can take the free 37 bus all the way up to the top and it’s worth the drive up there. The views are spectacular and the park itself is very well maintained and enjoyable. Perth is also a great base for day trips to the Margaret Valley, Swan Valley, as well as the iconic Pinnacles.</p>
<h2 id=margaret-valley:83f844163da5d3d70287000a4a71c6cd>Margaret Valley</h2>
<p>About a three-hour drive south from Perth, this day trip starts early and ends late, however it’s well worth the drive. The wineries are expansive and hiding behind gigantic trees. This region produces some world class Cabernet Sauvignon, so we decided to visit a few wineries for a tasting. From these we found Xanadu Winery, Voyager Estate, and Vasse Felix to be our favorites. Each offered great (and free!) tastings, however the Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve at Xanadu represented the region quite well.</p>
<h2 id=swan-valley:83f844163da5d3d70287000a4a71c6cd>Swan Valley</h2>
<p>Only one hour away from Perth, the small yet picturesque Swan Valley produces some fantastic wines and should not be overlooked. Two must visit vineries in this area are the Coward and Black Vineyard and the Olive Farm Wine and The Cheese Barrel. Coward and Black offers some great wines, some of which are produced at their winery in the Margaret Valley, while others originate from the Swan Valley itself, creating a great comparative tasting experience.</p>
<p>In addition one can taste various condiments and chocolate liquor at the Margaret and Swan Valley Chocolate Factory. The Olive Farm Wine offers an amazing tasting experience of varietal wines. The staff is superb and the winemaker’s passion shines through their wines. The Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon are both very beautifully structured wines. Easy to drink yet complex. Grab a bottle to take home and one to enjoy with a cheese pairing next door and you’re in for a treat.</p>
<h2 id=the-pinnacles:83f844163da5d3d70287000a4a71c6cd>The Pinnacles</h2>
<p>The Pinnacles is yet another early start and late evening kind of day tour, however well worth it. Roughly three hours away from Perth, the drive is not too eventful, and one might want to fill up the car with gas before leaving, yet once you arrive at the Nambung National Park the unique and mystical landscape makes up for it. The pillar shaped rock limestone formation spike out of the yellow-hued sand dunes creating a surreal landscape. Some taller then others, one can choose to wander around or simply follow the trail around the Pinnacles.</p>
