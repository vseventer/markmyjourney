<h2 id=phillip-island:15d69a1fb79643cbccc0508f5ac0cadd>Phillip Island</h2>
<p>Phillip Island is situated about two hours away from Melbourne by car, and makes for a great weekend getaway. We decided to stay in the center of the island, near Wimbledon Heights, as we decided to go to the Peninsula Hot Springs the following day.</p>
<p>We arrived on Phillip Island early afternoon, and decided to visit Woolamai Beach and the Pyramid Rock first. Around dinnertime, we decided to grab a bite in the main town on the island, Cowes, before heading to see the natural occurrence of the marching penguins on Phillip Island.</p>
<p>At the Penguin Parade, every evening at sunset, you can see these little guys march out of the water in groups and make their way up to their breeding grounds. Buy your tickets in advance, bring a blanket (it gets cold!) and grab a spot on the leftmost stand for the best views. We were happy that we ate dinner beforehand as a gang of seagulls attacked most people holding a tray of hot chips as they were trying to make it to the beach.</p>
<h2 id=mornington-peninsula:15d69a1fb79643cbccc0508f5ac0cadd>Mornington Peninsula</h2>
<p>The day after this cool but freezing experience, we properly defrosted ourselves at the relaxing Peninsula Hot Springs. Rotating between the different pools made the day fly by. We started with the jet-powered pool by the lake and moved our way up through the cave pool, Turkish steam room, sauna, Finish cold plunge, all the way up to the hot pool perched on top of a hill sporting some amazing landscape views. We left with baby smooth skin and a relaxed state of mind.</p>
