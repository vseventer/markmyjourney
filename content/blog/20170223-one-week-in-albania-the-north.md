After moving around a lot, and seeing a new country every few days, it was time to slow down. Where better to do that than in Albania, not very well known among tourists, and a bit of an undiscovered country. We stayed with Herta’s family, who also showed us all of Albania. We loved it so much, we just had to dedicate the next seven posts to teach you all about this beautiful country. Today: the north.

## Shkodër
Beforehand, it was hard to find much information on how exactly to enter Albania. There are no trains, flights are expensive, and bus schedules seemed nonexistent. Luckily, from [Kotor]({{< ref "20170219-san-giovannis-castle-of-kotor.md" >}}), there is a daily bus heading, via Podgorica, capital of Montenegro, to Shkodër. This city is the largest in the north of Albania, and the fifth-largest city overall. Now, Albania only has a population 2.75 million, and Shkodër is home to roughly 100,000 of them.

The final stop of our bus was near Sheshi Demokracia, the main square in Shkodër. There wasn’t really a bus station, it was merely a stop alongside a busy road. We were awaited by Herta’s family, and were off to explorer the city right away.

As it was Tuesday around noon, it was pretty quiet outside. We strolled along the main street, Rruga Kolë Idromeno, where the bars and restaurants were slowly opening up. As it was excruciatingly hot, we quickly got a refreshment and moved on.

We walked towards the car, and stopped for moment at the Xhamia e Madhe mosque (The Great Mosque). It is one of the few tourist sites in the center of an otherwise mostly economically-oriented city.

A few kilometers outside of Shkodër, next to the Bojana River, you can find Rozafa Castle. Due to its strategic location, the hill was the site of various sieges dating back to Roman times. Nowadays, for a mere 2$ you can visit the castle ruins, and enjoy the views.

On one side, you can see the Bojana River and the Buna River Protected Landscape. If you turn around, you have great views over the city of Shkodër, and mountains of Parku Maranai.

## Arbëri
From Shkodër, we drove roughly 90 minutes south towards the small town of Rrëshen. As we were tired from the bus ride the same morning, we were happy to hear what was in stock for us: a winetasting at the local Kantina Arbëri.

The winery is normally not accessible to tourists, but luckily our hosts knew the owner, and he was more than happy to show us around. We started by admiring the certifications and photos of celebrities who visited the winery in prior years. We learned that most of the wine is exported, mainly to the United States, and only a small number of bottles remains for consumption in Albania.

We enjoyed a variety of wines, including the 2006 Arbëri Kallmet, which was quite delicious. Apart from reds, the winery also produces a small amount of sparkling wine.

The final part of our visit brought us to the actual vineyards of the winery, only about ten minutes out. After a quick tour, it was time to head on. We would stay the night in the countries’ capital, Tirana, before continuing exploring other parts of the country. Our week in Albania only just started.
