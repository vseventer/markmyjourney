As our twelve day stay in Patagonia comes to an end, the next adventurous destination is already waiting for us. We will be flying from Punta Arenas to the capital of Santiago, stay overnight in the airport, and depart in the early morning to Easter Island!

Located five hours away from any land, Easter Island is a very special destination, known for the Moai statues all over the island. We will be camping here for a week, before heading back to Santiago on the 13th.

Our last day in Patagonia we spent grocery shopping: because of the remoteness of Easter Island grocery prices are four times as high as on the mainland, a great reason to bring everything with. So, we decided to empty one of our backpacks, and stuff it with groceries instead. That, plus a cooler full of beer will sure make for an awesome time.
