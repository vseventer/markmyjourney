After our brief visit to [Český Krumlov]({{< ref "20160704-cesky-krumlov-czech-republics-most-charming-town.md" >}}) we traveled three hours southwest, crossing the border with Austria and arriving in Salzburg. This would merely be a quick visit, as our itinerary dictated we had to take the train to [Vienna]({{< ref "20161012-vienna-europes-old-cultural-capital.md" >}}) the next day. After dropping of our bags at the newly opened hotel we were staying at, we went off for a self-guided walking tour.

From the Salzburg Hauptbahnhof (Central Station), we walked towards the Salzach River, which basically cuts the city in two. Our first sight was Mirabell Palace, with its beautiful Mirabell Gardens offering great views over Fortress Hohensalzburg.

We crossed the Müllner Steg Bridge, pausing in the middle of the bridge to enjoy the views of Salzburg Old Town in the distance.

We continued our walking tour on the south bank of the Salzach, heading into the center of Salzburg. We strolled past the shops on Griesgasse, and boutique stalls on Getreidegasse.

After a while we arrived at one of the most famous sights in Salzburg: the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, born on January 27, 1756.

From the Kapitelplatz, it is possible to take a funicular up to Fortress Hohensalzburg. The square is also home to the St. Peter’s Monastery. We moved on back towards the river, to finish up our walking tour on the north side of town.

Walking back to the Hauptbahnhof we once again were greeted with great views over Salzburg. On the north, we could see the Capuchin Monastery on the Kapuzinerberg, while looking south we had great views over picturesque Old Town.

Our last stop was at Mozart’s Residence, where Mozart lived with his family after the house where he was born became too small. The residence nowadays is a museum showcasing Mozart’s life. After purchasing a small violin souvenir, we called it a day and headed back to our hotel.
