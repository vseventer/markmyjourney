After about 15 minutes of heavy turbulence due to a rainstorm, our plane landed safely in Foz do Iguaçu. Because it rained badly and the bus was not clearly marked we opted for a taxi drive into the town. After an unpleasant start we were happy to arrive at our hostel, which turned out to be one of our favorites. The town of Foz do Iguaçu is popular among tourists for one reason: it offers access to the Brazilian side of the Iguazú Falls.

Our hostel was right accross the bus stop, so getting to the falls was pretty straightforward. Once there, the National Parks’ shuttle bus brought you to the actual trail. It was a quite simple one-way trail that allowed for many panoramic views of the falls, and at one point offered a very close (and wet) look. The Brazilian side turned out to be the best side for getting the big picture.

The next day, we crossed into Argentinas’ Puerto Iguazú, from where to Argentinian side of the falls is easily reachable. After paying another entrance fee, we entered the park, but found the facilities were not as well maintained as on the Brazilian side. Also, we had to wait 15 minutes for each of the two train rides that it took to get to the actual falls. However, the Argentinian part has very good walkways which allow you to get a closer look. Just watch out for the slippery paths, and the sneaky coati animals, who stole our cookie.
