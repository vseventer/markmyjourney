A weekend trip to Copenhagen is the perfect opportunity to explore the Danish capital. The city is best explored on foot, strolling through the compact city center to the cities’ iconic mermaid and fortress, tracking back to its colorful waterfront, finishing off with amazing street food at the Paper Island.

We visited Copenhagen in November, around the time winter arrived in the city as well. Despite the clear blue sky, temperatures hovered around freezing, with gloves and hats being a requirement to stay warm. After catching a quick and delicious breakfast around the Central Station, we started our walking tour at the Christiansborg Palace. This palace, with a large horse riding ground in front, is the seat of the Danish parliament.

From the palace, it is only a short stroll through the Strøget shopping street towards Copenhagen’s most famous area: Nyhavn. This extremely touristy street along the harbor consists of dozens of differently colored houses, a fantastic sight. During our visit, Nyhavn hosted an early Christmas market, and we welcomed a cup of mulled wine while enjoying the surroundings.

After our quick stop at Nyhavn (we would return later), we walked along the quiet quay towards The Little Mermaid. This statue is right up there with Manneken Pis in Brussels, when it comes to disappointingly small statues. Nevertheless, the views over the Øresund strait towards Sweden were quite impressive (in good weather, you are able to Sweden).

We turned around and started making our way back to Nyhavn. On our right, we passed the Kastellet, the cities’ fortress. We didn’t feel like exploring this site in depth, even though admission is free. We settled for a nice picture of the St. Alban’s Church.

Just before reaching the city center, we passed through Amalienborg, the Queen’s winter residence. On certain days, you are supposedly able to see the Queen arriving or departing by car from the residence. Apart from the residence itself, part of the building is a museum.

We arrived back in Nyhavn just before dusk. We decided to walk across the bridge towards Paper Island, to enjoy some semi-affordable street food at the Street Food market, which we highly recommend. Not long after, crossed the bridge back, and were greeted by yet another view of the harbor.

We finished of our visit by walking back through the Strøget shopping street. We made a quick stop at the iconic LEGO Store, before arriving back at our accommodation. At this point, the sun had long set, and temperatures had dropped below freezing, concluding our visit to Copenhagen.
