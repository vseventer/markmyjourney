The most populated area in Scotland is located north of [Lake District National Park]({{< ref "20170311-a-cloudy-day-in-lake-district-national-park.md" >}}) and just south of the [Highlands]({{< ref "20170311-the-scottish-highlands.md" >}}). The countries’ two biggest cities, Glasgow and Edinburgh, both have about 500,000 inhabitants, and are only one hour apart. On the way north, we stopped in Glasgow, while going south we stopped in Edinburgh, admiring its iconic hilltop castle.

## Glasgow
We parked our rental car in the St. Enoch Shopping Centre, one of many malls in Glasgow, and went on our way. Once outside, we decided to walk along Bucharan Street, the main boulevard. As it was an early Wednesday morning, it was still quiet outside, apart from the coffee shops who opened their doors early to serve thirsty commuters.

After a few minutes, we went off the main street towards George Square. The square is home to the Glasgow City Chambers, home to the local government. In front of this building, you can see the Cenotaph, a memorial dedicated to World War I victims. Around the square, you will also find a series of statues of former Prime Ministers.

Walking back towards the shopping area, you will stumble upon the impressive St. George’s Tron Church. It is the oldest building in the area, dating back to the early 19th century. In recent years, the church was refurbished as the structure of the tower had gotten too weak.

As we only planned for a quick stop, we already turned back towards our car. Tucked away Argyle Street, you can see a glimpse of Glasgow Central Station. It is a few decades older then the Tron Church, and with over 30 million passengers the busiest station in all of Scotland.
