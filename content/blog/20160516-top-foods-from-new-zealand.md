Similar to their [Australian](/top-foods-from-australia/) neighbors, you won’t expect to find foods particular to New Zealand. However, during [our trip to New Zealand](/new-zealand-by-campervan/), we found some Kiwi favorites worth a try. For example, we discovered some fruits not found anywhere else, plus some strange foods that are very common on the island.

In the breakfast department, we firstly tried **spaghetti on toast**. A bit strange to think about and even stranger in taste, this Kiwi favorite is quite easy to prepare, all you need is toast and Wattie’s spaghetti. Similar to its neighboring vegemite, **marmite** is best enjoyed thinly spread over a heavily buttered toasted piece of bread. Unlike vegemite, marmite is a bit tamer in taste and is less salty.

The **kiwifruit**, simply referred to as “kiwi”, is the slightly tart green fruit that is widely popular and easily available in many countries. However, the closely related golden kiwi, which is slightly sweeter and, as the name hints, golden in color, should also be tried as this variety is abundant in New Zealand.

We also found the **kiwiano** in the fruit isle: this is a spiky shaped fruit that taste like a mix of cucumber, banana, and kiwi. After cutting it in half you can squeeze its jelly-like contents into a bowl and either eat it all or simply suck out the fleshy green part of it and discard the seeds. However, the seeds are perfectably edible and we actually preferred eating both juice and seeds, as it was way easier to prepare. Next to the kiwiano we found **feijoas**. Originally from South America, Feijoas are extremely popular in New Zealand. With a sweet and sour combo taste, it tastes great eaten as is or in smoothies.

In between meals, people enjoy **chocolate fish**. As the name hints, the chocolate fish is a fish shaped chocolate with a chewy marshmallow-like pink center. Some people like to dunk their fish into a nice hot beverage.
Similar to the chocolate fish **pineapple lumps** contain a marshmallow like square center that is covered in chocolate. However, as the name hints this center is yellow and tastes like pineapple. We actually preferred these to the chocolate fish.

Although the name might be slightly misleading, the **Afghan cookie** is a Kiwi original. This popular biscuit consists or cornflakes mixed with cocoa and topped with a chocolate icing and a half caramelized walnut on top. Similar in taste to a brownie, this chocolaty delight goes great with a cup of coffee.

Finally, **Whittaker’s peanut slab** is a solid piece of milk chocolate combined with peanuts, which is quite popular throughout the country. In between meals, **manuka honey** is often used as supplement. World-renowned for it’s many health benefits, this honey is proudly advertised throughout the country. It’s quite pricy, however definitely worth a try.

For dinner, Kiwis surely love their **fish and chips**. Not surprisingly, given that the country used to be a colony of the United Kingdom. The fish was usual hoki and quite delicious when cooked fresh. Fish and chips are pretty much available at every restaurant. **Kumara**, the sweet potato is very popular in New Zealand and is offered in most restaurants in the form of fries and in supermarkets in the form of fries as well as chips.

Lambs play an important role in the New Zealand’s massive wool industry. But, when prepared correctly, it’s quite tasty to eat too. We sampled a **lamb shoulder** from Pedro’s House of Lamb, which was cheap, delicious, and super tender. Another popular meat is **venison**. This tastes a bit like beef mixed with a bit of lamb. Best eaten medium-rare, the fjord venison is tender and packed with flavor.

**New Zealand mussels** are referred to as green-lipped mussels due to their unique bright green color lining the edges of the mussel. These tasty mussels can be bought still alive in the supermarket as well as show up in most restaurants with seafood. Definitely worth a try!

Often, a meal is accompanied by **L&P**, a popular New Zealand beverage. It resembles sparking lemonade, somewhat similar to Mountain Dew, and its presence is huge in New Zealand.

For desert, the country offers a variety of different ice creams. Fun to say and even more fun to eat, **Hokey Pokey** ice cream is a delicious vanilla ice cream mixed in with crunchy honeycomb toffee. This flavor is so popular, it can also be found in seasoning and chocolate.

**Real fruit ice cream** is widely advertised in New Zealand. We chose to try the strawberry variety, which basically consists of frozen strawberries mixed in with vanilla ice cream in a special blending machine. The outcome is a perfectly mixed soft-serve looking ice cream.

Finally, New Zealand is a big player in the **wine** industry. Its strength lies within white wines, with the Marlborough and Hawke’s Bay producing great Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, and Sauvignon Blanc. However, the Otago region, near Queenstown, is well known for producing amazing Pinot Noirs.

* The best: **venison** for dinner, and **manuka honey** on yoghurt or in tea.
* The worst: **spaghetti on toast**.
* The healthiest: **manuka honey**, or the **kiwifruit**.
