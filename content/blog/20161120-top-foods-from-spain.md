Spain is one of our favorite food destinations as it offers gourmet bites on the go. As you may have noticed from our other food posts, we don’t usually like lengthy dinners, but we do like good food. Most restaurants in Spain have a tapas bar, and it’s almost guaranteed that if there is a decent amount of people in the restaurant, the food is going to be delicious. We loved being able to grab different tapas, which are ready to go on the counter, and wash them down with delicious yet quite affordable wine.

## Olive oil
While visiting the wine region of Spain we were offered bread with olive oil at almost every winery, and we were quite surprised how flavorful it was. We ended up eating the bread basket as a main. We always thought Italian olive oil was the best, but now actually prefer the taste of the Spanish olive oil. On the way home, we made sure to buy olive oil to take home from the duty free shop.

## Tapas
Tapas come in all different shapes and colors. You can find anything from bread topped with cheese and jalapeño to octopus salad. The choices are endless and ready to go.

## Ham croquetas
We could not get enough of these. The deep fried combo of béchamel, cheese,
and ham, rolled in breadcrumbs is irresistible.

## Jamón ibérico
Although we loved this type of cured ham, after we saw the price of bringing a package home, we decided to go with wine instead. We picked tapas with ibérico ham every chance we got, and this is probably the cheapest way to satisfy any cravings.

## Mouthwatering meat
We usually talk about food rather than specific restaurants, but the La Cuchara de San Telmo restaurant was so damn good and cheap that we just had to mentioned it. We had, hands down, one of the best meats here. We ordered the veal cheek, the octopus, and a handful of accompanying smaller dishes. We paid about 30 dollars, and were full and happy. Their wine selection at two dollars per glass was also superb, do try the finca.

## Paella
If there is one food that’s worth waiting 45 minutes for, it’s Paella. This rice-based dish is quite filling as it usually has ingredients such as chicken, meat, vegetables, or mixed seafood. It’s prepared on an open fire and takes times to cook properly.

## Patatas Bravas
If you go out for a couple beers and find yourself hungry, you can always buy yourself some one euro patatas bravas. It’s basically potatoes with a special spicy sauce that consists of tomato, red pepper, vinegar, olive oil, paprika, and a bit of chili for a kick.

## Churros
Churros are quite a popular Spanish food in other parts of the world, however we didn’t see much of it in Spain itself, except in the touristy areas of Madrid. The combo of deep fried dough and chocolate is quite delicious, if freshly prepared.

## Sangria
Ah, what is a barbeque without some refreshing Sangria? We found that this drink, like churros, is one of those things that tourist prefer more than locals do. We decided to try it anyway, however found that we preferred wine by itself, not mixed. Sangria is a summery drink that is made with citrus juice, chopped fruit, wine, a bit of brandy, and ice.
