During our time in Albania we enjoyed heavy lunches and late dinners, with little snacks in between. One thing is for sure; you always want to go for a siesta after lunch. Throughout this post you will see countless items that are popular not only in Albania, but all over the Balkans.

After an already gigantic lunch filled with meat, potatoes and salce kosi (thick, slightly tart yogurt dip) washed down with a couple beers and some wine to be safe, we arrived home around 10pm to find a table filled with more food then we could ever eat. We found that generous serving sizes were considered a must to being a good host in this general region. As we were mostly on the road, we ate out often, but we still did get our fair share of home cooked meals as well.

## Breakfast

### Trahana
Although Mark did not like the distinct taste of this dish, I quite enjoyed my breakfast trahana, which is basically a mixture of grain and yogurt that has been fermented and dried out. It looks like couscous and when combined with water results in a soup like mixture. It has a slightly acidic taste, which I love when combined with feta, shredded bread and a hefty dose of olive oil.

### Petulla
This is basically fried dough that can be dipped in any of the numerous dips or feta, and if you want something sweet you can also roll these around in a bit of sugar for breakfast…just don’t log it into your fitbit!

## Appetizers

### Japrak me gjethe rrushi
These are basically grape leaves stuffed with a mixture of rice and spices, which is also very popular in Greece (Dolmades) and surrounding countries. We did not quite like the taste of these, but thought it was worth a try.

### Salce kosi
This is a must try when in Albania! We ate it basically during every single lunch. This can be described as being similar to the Greek tzatziki. It is very thick yogurt mixed together with garlic, salt; sometimes cucumbers while other times walnuts and is topped with what else but olive oil! It’s a delicious dip and it’s quite nice with French fries and qofte (meatballs)

### Djadh I bardhe djath kackavalli
There are two dominant cheeses in Albania, the feta one on the right and semi-hard salty yellow cheese on the left. There is no such thing as a small piece of cheese in Albania. If you are ordering cheese you’re probably getting at least 5-7 large pieces. It’s quite popular to eat feta together with watermelon, especially on a hot beach day and if you’re ordering a salad you’re most definitely getting a huge piece of feta on top, similar to what you would see in Greece.

### Cevapcici 
These homemade style long meatballs are really delicious when washed down with some beer. We ordered some delicious ones from a beer garden we visited in Korce.

## Lunch & Dinner

### Suflaqe
Looks familiar? Well that’s because it’s pretty much like the Greek gyro. These are quite popular all over Albania. The contents are shaved meat, salce kosi, tomatoes, salad and French fries all wrapped up in a nice warm pita bread. We ordered this several times as it was quick and delicious.

### Byrek
You will find many versions of this beloved food in the Balkans as well as in Turkey. Whether the fillo dough is filled with spinach, feta, beans or meat you can’t escape trying it somewhere along the Balkans. This is quite satisfying as a meal of its own or as a snack. We quite loved the cheese one and our two favorite were a homemade one in Albania and one we tried in a small shop in Sarajevo.

### Grilled fish
Especially along the coast, you can find a lot of restaurants serving up a great tasting and healthy char grilled fresh fish. This was a welcomed meal after all the suflaqe(gyros)

### Speca te mbushura
This is a popular homemade meal, which consists of whole peppers stuffed with a mixture of rice and minced meat. Sprinkle some feta on top and you’re in for a filling meal. We found this dish was also quite popular in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

### Ferges
This is definitely one of my favorite foods. Making this dish is quite simple, all you need to do is mix farmer’s cheese with tomatoes, lots of peppers, eggs and spices and let is simmer. This dish is always nice to eat with some freshly baked bread!

### Mish qingji ne hell
It’s quite common to see advertisements for whole pit roasted lamb, especially in mountainous areas. We stopped at a restaurants specializing in meats and ordered a serving of this and about 10 other kinds of meats. Although the meat was quite tender, we tended to like the biftek (char grilled beef) more.

### Groshe
This is a tomato based stew with beans, which is quite popular in the Balkans. It’s considered a comfort food and is also sometimes eaten for breakfast for strength. We didn’t particularly like or disliked it.

## Dessert

### Baklava, Tullumba
Yet another dessert that’s popular all over this region. The left picture is baklava made from filo layers filled with chopped up nuts and drenched in syrup, while the right is tullumba (Albanian churros) which is fried up batter also drenched in syrup. There is no way of escaping these sweet treats, however we liked to eat them accompanied by some strong black coffee to counterbalance the sweetness.

## Drinks

### Frappe
This is a popular choice to order on the beach. Coffee based drinks are really important in Albania and we stopped perhaps every 2 hours for a coffee break. Basically there wasn’t a rest stop without a coffee included, which we didn’t mind at all since we always got a perfect macchiato.

### Raki
In some countries it’s apples in Albania it’s a shot of Raki a day that keeps the doctor away. Another thing you can’t escape without trying at least once in the Balkans is Raki. This strong drink produced from grapes is intense. We didn’t quite like it, but it’s worth a try.

### Fanta exotic
This type of Fanta is our favorite kind as it has a passion fruit like taste to it, although we usually don’t drink carbonated drinks, this was our to go drink on the beach.

### AMF (adios mother******)
Well, you can’t leave Albania without going clubbing at least once, so we decided to get this popular drink and as the name suggests…this drink is basically a mix or hard liquors with a dash of blue curacao..there isn’t much 7-up in the Albanian version.

### Caj mali
This is a special tea from the mountains of Albania and it has a very distinctive taste to it. We loved this drink and even though it was summer, drank it in the evenings. It’s definitely a must try.
