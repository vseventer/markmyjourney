After embarking on our journey on Saturday night, we arrived in Amsterdam around noon on Sunday. The flight with Icelandair was decent, but don’t expect any food. We tried to get as much sleep as possible, yet still we managed to sleep in until 2:30PM on Monday. Jetlag, anyone?

In preparation of the [Amsterdam Marathon](http://www.tcsamsterdammarathon.nl/en/), the next few days we’ll be taking it easy. Nevertheless, we will still be catching up with family and friends, exploring my home town of Mijdrecht, and spending a day or two in Amsterdam.

For now, a slice of bread with chocolate sprinkles for breakfast sounds pretty good.
