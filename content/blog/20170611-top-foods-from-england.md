Like [Scotland]({{< ref "20170615-top-foods-from-scotland.md" >}}), the British cuisine isn’t too extensive. Most foods consist of some sort of fried ingredient, which is not particularly delicious or healthy. One thing we definitely liked is a traditional English high tea with delicious scones!

## Traditional English breakfast
The traditional English breakfast! When strolling around London, you won’t be able to escape the pictures outside restaurants luring tourists in. To be blunt, we like to think of it as cholesterol on a plate, with things like fried sausages, fried bacon, fried eggs, fried warm tomato (yuck), sautéed mushrooms, and beans. We could not imagine, who wakes up at 7am craving this?

We contemplated several times whether to try this, and hold off as long as we could. Luckily, an Airbnb host offered to make us a traditional English breakfast made from scratch! Our host baked (not fried!) everything, and used high quality ingredients (like Canadian instead of English bacon, something you won’t be able to find in a restaurant). We still didn’t care much for the sausage, however we’re extremely happy with the other dishes, which tasted delicious.

## Cornish pastry
When visiting [Cornwall]({{< ref "20170528-easter-break-in-cornwall.md" >}}), you will be amazed by the Cornish pastry. These pastries resemble the [Argentinian empanada]({{< ref "20150223-top-foods-from-argentina.md" >}}), however is way denser and bigger. Although in theory, it’s a nice on the go snack, we found the filling way too heavy, and the dough too dense.

## High tea
Going for a high tea is one of our favorites, although quite pricy (over 40 pounds per person), however definitely worth the splurge (once). At the high tea, small sandwiches are served alongside our favorite: fresh scones with jam and clotted cream. There is also a wide selection of teas, as well as champagne if desired. If you are on a really tight budget, [Sky Garden](https://skygarden.london) (free admission with prior booking), has great scones (and regular tea).

## Steak pie
Steak pie, fish pie, shepherds pie: the British surely love their pies, however not the American way. Instead, they put anything from steak with gravy, fish, or minced lamb with mash in their pies. They are quite hearty and heavy, so we aren’t quite the fan. Steak pies are also usually topped with a brown sauce, but we prefer the [Australian]({{< ref "20160428-top-foods-from-australia.md" >}}) version of this sauce.

## Fish and chips
The ultimate English dish, fish and chips, consists of fried fish and chips, usually sprinkled with salt and vinegar. Although we generally try to stay away from fried foods, fish and chips can be quite an enjoyable fast food.

Some restaurants, like [Harrods](https://www.harrods.com), try to fancy it up, but essentially it’s quite tough to mess up fish and chips anyway, as long as it is freshly prepped. Fish and chips is also a staple at any decent pub, which there is an unproportional number of. You can opt to wash your meal down with a nice beer, although you should probably be warned that English beer is served flat and warm (who thought of that?), so maybe go for a Foster instead?
