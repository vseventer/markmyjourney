The Czech Republic is well known for its beautiful architectural cities, and of course its beer. We decided to combine both by visiting the countries capital: Prague. After a four hour busride from [Krak√≥w](/top-things-to-do-in-poland-visit-warsaw-and-krakow/), we arrived in the city.

Prague is a big and international city. Although it's pretty westernized, prices are still low, funnily beer is actually cheaper than water or any other beverage in Prague. Another interesting fact about Prague is that a lot of Hollywood movies depicting other European cities are actually exclusively filmed in different parts of Prague, because of it's diversity.

Despite being a bit city, the old and new parts of Prague can be easily explored by foot. We started in the Old Town square, where the famous Astronomical Clock is located, the oldest of its kind. From there, we went to the X, where Mozart first received recognition for his work. He played most of the pieces himself in X, and his piece of marriage of figaro is arguably the best opera ever written.

After passing the black Madonna, which houses the museum of cubism as well as a cubism-themed cafe. More gothic and art nouveau architecture can be found all around Prague, including the municipal house which is a must see! It's a great place to hear quality classical music.

After passing the Franz Kafka square, which was smaller and less glamorous then we expected, we headed to the Jewish quarter, where the buildings were spared during World War II, as the Nazis wanted to proof to future generations there once was such a thing as Jewish culture. Luckily, these horrible intentions have a silver lining, as the old new Synagogue, as well as six other synagogues can still be viewed.

We finished our walking tour along the X river, with a beautiful view over the Charles Bridge and the Old Castle.
