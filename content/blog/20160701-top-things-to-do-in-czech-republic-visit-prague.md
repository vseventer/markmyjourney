The Czech Republic is well known for its beautiful architectural cities, and of course its beer. We decided to combine both by visiting the countries’ capital: Prague. We arrived in the city after a four-hour bus ride from [Kraków](/top-things-to-do-in-poland-visit-warsaw-and-krakow/), after which we started exploring right away.

Prague is a big and international city. Although it’s pretty westernized, prices are still low, with beer funnily being cheaper than water or any other beverage. Another interesting fact about Prague is that a lot of Hollywood movies depicting other European cities are actually exclusively filmed in different parts of Prague, because of its diversity and cheapness.

Despite being a big city, the old and new parts of Prague can be easily explored on foot. We started in the Old Town square, where the famous Astronomical clock is located, the oldest one still operating. From there, we went to the Estates Theatre, where Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart first received recognition for his work. He played most of the pieces himself in the theatre, and his piece of *Figaro* is arguably the best opera ever written.

Continuing on we passed the House of the Black Madonna, which houses the Museum of Cubism as well as a cubism-themed café. More gothic and art nouveau architecture can be found all around Prague, including the Municipal House, which is a must see! It’s a great place to hear quality classical music.

Next, after briefly visiting the underwhelming Wenceslas Square, we headed to the Jewish quarter. The buildings in this area were spared during World War II, as the Nazis wanted to be able to proof to future generations there once was such a thing as Jewish culture. Luckily, these horrible intentions have a silver lining, as the Old new Synagogue, as well as seven other synagogues in the city can still be viewed today.

We finished our walking tour along the Vltava river, with a beautiful view over the parliament, old Prague Castle, and Charles Bridge.
