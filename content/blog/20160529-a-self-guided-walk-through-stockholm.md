Stockholm is a very walkable city; the old and new part of town are only a bridge apart, while ferries bring you to museums and parks a little further away. As the weather was incredibly nice for the time of year, we decided to spend the day walking from the new part of town to the Old Town, wrapping up the day in Slussen, just south of the Old Town.

We started our day at the local Östermalm Food Hall, which is a great starting point to sample some traditional Swedish produce or indulge in fresh seafood at one of the restaurants. We then made our way to Central Station via the picturesque Kungsträdgården park and Gallerian mall. Just outside Central Station there are plenty of shopping opportunities, as well as bars and cafés along Kungsgatan.

Walking south, one passes through the old city gates and onto the Riksdaghuset, home to the Swedish parliament. The palace (Sweden is a monarchy) and cobblestone streets lined with souvenir shops and cafés add a certain charm to the Old Town. We stopped for a delicious soft-serve ice cream topped with freshly prepared whipped cream and cloudberry jam, before ending the day in Slussen, which, due to its elevation, provided a great panorama over Stockholm. On a summer day like this, we highly recommend simply going for a long stroll around the city.
