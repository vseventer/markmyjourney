The French cuisine is arguably one of the finest cuisines in the world. Usually petite in size, but grand in flavor, it is nearly impossible to summarize the top French foods in a short list; so we have come up with a small fraction of foods we thought are must try items when visiting France.

## Macarons
Ah macarons! Only a couple of tiny bite sizes big, these circular almond based cakes surely excite the taste buds. Nowadays, you can find specialty macaroon shops all over the world, but you won’t quite find any that match the quality of the ones in the streets of Paris. The two small circular almond based cakes are usually held together with a filling, like salted caramel, chocolate, and the list goes on. We ran into a store in Paris that produced macarons which weren’t the prettiest, but had a great taste.

## Croissant
Created by folding and rolling thin layers of dough, the end result is a buttery, crescent shaped fluffy deliciousness known as a croissant. Although in no way a healthy breakfast, we had this for breakfast in France every single day. This is yet another item that you can find anywhere in the world, however tastes the best in France.

## Éclair
Yet another delicious French pastry. Éclairs are tubular shaped pasties made from choux pastry, which is then filled with a variety of fillings such as vanilla custard, before being covered with a strip of chocolate icing. The combination is addictive.

## Baguette
The one thing you will definitely see anywhere around in France, especially in the mornings, is a half-eaten baguette sticking out of grocery bags. This iconic bread is long, thin, and crispy on the outside, yet deliciously fluffy and soft on the inside. The smell dominates and it’s nearly impossible to stop yourself from biting off at least the top. Although the French are quite keen on their two-hour lunch breaks, we much preferred our quick and never disappointing baguette with brie and dried beef slices.

## Ratatouille and pâté
Although we generally grab a fresh baguette during most of our lunches in France, we had time to sit down for lunch in Champagne. We ended up ordering ratatouille, which is a vegetable stew made from aubergines, zucchini, onions, and tomatoes. This dish possibly has the tastiest vegetables you will ever taste.

At the same Restaurant Le 36, we also decided to try out pâté. Although Herta generally doesn’t like pâté, this particular restaurant did an excellent job. The duck pâté was velvety and delicious on crispy bread.

## Burgundy snails
The thought of trying snails wasn’t always a pleasant one, however once we tried them we were quite amazed by the taste. It wasn’t as chewy or slimy as we envisioned, but rather intriguing. This dish is an absolute must try when in Burgundy.

## Beef bourguignon
This hearty stew is a well-known staple in the French cuisine and a must try
when visiting Burgundy. Beef is braised in a combination of red wine, pearl
onions, mushrooms, garlic, bouquet garni (thyme, bay leaves, sage), and beef
broth. The end result is a haute comfort food that is not to be missed.

## Crêpe
You can’t escape France without trying a crêpe, although nowadays it’s a popular snack all over the world. Mix in a bit of flour, eggs, and milk, and you got yourself a crêpe. However, the perfect crêpe, like in France, has to be thin. One of the most popular filling options is nutella, however we quite enjoyed the salted caramel version as well. You can also find many savory options, however we prefer ours sweet.

## Mustard
Dijon, a city in the northeast of France, is home to the famous Dijon Mustard. We sampled a variety of mustard in the official store, and were amazed by the truffle mustard. Although, in the end, the original one still tastes the best.
