In Europe, the Easter Weekend consists of four days, as most people have Friday and Monday of too. It allowed us to take a short break and drive a few hours to the South of England, to visit Cornwall and surroundings. Even though the motorways were packed, we embraced the traffic jams and headed out for a long Easter Break in Cornwall.

## Bristol
After being stranded on the motorway for a good hour due to a vehicle fire, we finally made it halfway to Cornwall. We decided to make a quick stop in Bristol, a mid-size city with just under half a million inhabitants. The city center consists of mostly shopping areas, some of them quite modern and well designed.

We left Bristol via the west, by taking the iconic Clifton Suspension Bridge. This bridge, spanning 100 meters above the Avon River, is one of the major tourist attractions in the area. For 1£, you can cross this bridge by car, and stop on either side to make a few pictures.

## Cornwall
Due to the traffic, we arrived in the Cornwall area about three hours later then planned. We changed our plans, and decided to head to Looe, a small coastal town on the southeast corner of Cornwall. The towns in this area of the country look very similar, with a harbor surrounded by houses built on the hillside.

The center of Looe consists of a main street, with a few connected alleyways, offering plenty of eating and shopping opportunities. Unsurprisingly, the most popular cuisine around here is seafood, and almost every dish will include fish of some kind.

After hours of driving, our day finally came to an end in Porthleven, in the southern tip of England. As with Looe, the harbor forms the central area of the town. We merely stayed the night here, and since Porthleven is very small (around 3,000 inhabitants), don't expect as much liveliness as in Looe. There is, however, a yearly food festival, mostly concentrated on seafood.

The next morning, we rose early as we had plenty to see. Our first stop was just 20 minutes outside Porthleven, at St. Michael’s Mount. This small island just off Marazion is home to a castle, gardens, and market. At low tide, there is a cobblestone pathway from shore to castle. We visited on a Saturday, when the castle is closed, and also during high tide.

We continued our journey, bringing us to Porthcurno next. Our first stop was Porthcurno Beach, one of the most beautiful beaches of Cornwall. Looking at it, it wouldn’t be out of place if located in the Mediterranean. It was slightly chilly, so it was pretty quiet at the beach.

Only a few minutes from the beach, either by car or by taking the coastal walking trail, you can visit The Minack Theatre. This open-air theatre is built on the rocky shore, and has a capacity of 750. The theatre was built in the early 20th century, initially for one play only, but it has been in service since.

For lunch, we headed to St. Ives, a small town on the western side of Cornwall. After parking on the hill (the city center is car free) and taking the shuttle bus down, we walked around the small alleyways of St. Ives, towards the beach.

At low tide, the beach of St. Ives takes up the entire harbor, leaving boats on dry land. At many of the boulevard restaurants, you can pick up a tasty fish and chips lunch, or traditional Cornish pastry. If the weather is good, definitely go for an ice cream as well.

Our last stop before leaving Cornwall was Torquay, also known as the capital of the English Riviera. It is the most popular place to retire in the United Kingdom, and its many seaside homes made it clear why. The area around the harbor is quite touristy as well, with a ferris wheel, a few restaurants, and plenty of people admiring the yachts in the harbor itself.
