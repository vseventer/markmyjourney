The city that never sleeps resembles Bangkok for us now. Upon exiting the plane, Mark being in a non-Western culture for the first time, we entered a different world. This city has so much going on, and will drag you with.

We stayed four days in Bangkok before heading to Chiang Mai in the search of a more quiet place. But, we enjoyed Bangkok for what it had to offer: a thriving streetfood scene, beautiful historic buildings, and armies of motorbikes, tuk tuks, and taxis.

On our last day, we also found quietness in Bangkokâ€™s own parks: Queen Sirikit, located 10kms outside of the city center, and Suan Lumphini. We will be back in Bangkok later this month to explorer the northwestern part of the city before flying to Cambodia. But until then, we can recover from the overwhelming impression the city made on us.
