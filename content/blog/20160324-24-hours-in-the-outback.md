A visit to the Outback, the vast desert region in the center of Australia, is a must-do when living in Australia. We opted for a brief 24-hour visit to one of the most visited parts of the Outback: Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, home to the rock formations of Kata Tjuta and Uluru.

## Kata Tjuta
The closest city to Uluru is Alice Springs, a mere six hours away. Therefore, we decided to fly into Ayers Rock Airport directly, and after picking up our rental car we were on our way. The first stop were the 36 red-rock domes of Kata Tjuta, also known as The Olgas.

While walking to the viewpoint, we were greeted with what turned out to be a very common thing in the Outback: flies. Desperate for moisture, they buzzed around our heads, lips, nose, and ears. After making an extremely quick picture, we made our best purchase ever: mosquito nets.

Safe from the flies, we continued our sightseeing by getting closer to the rock formation. Contrary to Uluru, which appears to be one solid rock, The Olgas consist of 36 separate rocks. We didnâ€™t spend much time walking around, as temperatures rose to the mid-30s.

## Uluru
The main sight of the area is of course Uluru (or Ayers Rock) itself. We spent time waiting for sunset and sunrise, as well as getting up close to see the rock from nearby. It definitely has something magical, as it is surrounded by desert nothingness. After a short walk in the shade provided by the rock, it was already time to head back to the village of Yulara, the only town providing lodging, entertainment, food, and gas.

Budget accommodation is sparse in Yulara - a private bed in the only hostel costs around 200$ per night. We opted for a bed in a dorm instead, which was still pricy at 40$ a night. The town had a small supermarket, allowing us to stock up on snacks, before enjoying the live music at nighttime together with all the other tourists. The next morning, after seeing the sunrise at Uluru, it was already time to head back to the airport.
