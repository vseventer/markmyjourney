The two main things that come to mind when thinking about Austrian food is definitely the Schnitzel and Apfelstrudel, however of course Austrian cuisine has a lot more to offer. One day of trying Austrian food pretty much wiped out our carbs for the week! As it was extremely expensive to eat our in Austria and we only had a limited time, we tried to stick to a few must try foods.

## Kaiserschmarrn
This dish is pretty much a meal in itself. Usually served in a hot pan, Kaiserschmarrn is basically a fluffy pancake cut into small bits and pieces sprinkled with powder sugar and served with a plum dipping sauce. We basically inhaled these even though we were ridiculously full from our mains already.

## Käsespätzle
This is basically Austria’s version of mac&cheese. The dish usually uses egg noddles and emmentaler cheese and is topped with sautéed or fried onions. It’s just as delicious as it sounds.


## Apfelstrudel
The Wienese strudel consists of a thin oval filo like pastry stuffed with an apple filling. We weren’t too fond of this version and actually prefer versions that have a more cake like layer like the Dutch apple cake for an example.

## Schnitzel
We couldn’t leave Austria without trying the famous Wiener Schnitzel, that consists of fried battered veal slices with a serving of potatoe salad. We actually were a bit disappointed and prefer the pan cooked version from Schnitz in Melbourne.

## Viennies chocolate cake
Also known as the “Original” Sacher Torte, even though this cake looks like it’s essentially a dark chocolate fudge cake, it is quite delicate and has a layer of apricot jam that stands out from the chocolate. We liked it, but didn’t necessarily love it. Definitely worth a try with a cup of black coffee.


## Manner Schnitten
These hazelnut wafers were quite a nice sweet snack. We went with the wholegrain version which helped us think we were eating healthy, while we finished 5 packets in 2 days.
