Often characterized as dirty, full of graffiti, and dangerous, Naples is a city with mixed reviews. People often visit this region to see Pompeii and the Amalfi Coast, and leave Naples as soon as they arrive. We, however, decided to see for ourselves what Naples is like, before rejoining the tourist trail in the ancient city of Pompeii.

## Naples
Naples International Airport is only a stones’ throw away from the city. However, traffic in this area of Italy is horrible, the roads are overcrowded with scooters, and no one seems to follow any traffic law. After parking on the easternmost end of the city, we exited the parking lot just in time to witness a biker getting knocked off his bike by a scooter. Welcome to Naples!

Once in the city, it is easy and cheap to get around by metro. We exited near the Old City, and upon exiting we were greeted by Castel Nuovo. TODO: DESCRIBE CASTLE. Apart from this castle, Napels is also home to HARBOR CASTLE near the harbor.

After a short walk from Castel Nuovo we arrived at the Piazza del Plebiscito, home to the San Francesco di Paola. DESCRIBE BOTH.

From here, we had a 20-minute walk ahead of us in order to reach the Old City gates. We strolled north along the XXX BOULEVARD, which offers excellent food opportunities. We grabbed a mozzarella sandwich, fresh cannoli, slice of pizza, and a macchiato, all equally delicious. When it comes to food, Naples certainly delivers.

After entering the Old City, we understood why some people don’t like Naples. There indeed is a lot of graffiti, the streets are narrow, with cars forcing their way through regardless. We, however, quite liked the charm of it. The colorful buildings, with small stores on the ground floor and apartments with balcony above, laundry left hanging out to dry, it all gives Naples a very authentic feeling.

The Old City of Naples is home to a number of churches, all tucked away in the small streets. One of them is San Paolo Maggiore. DESCRIBE HERE. Afterwards, we went back to our car, and left for Pompeii. To us, Naples is definitely worth a visit, as it is one of the most authentic and charming cities in Italy.

## Pompeii
Pompeii, thirty (?) minutes from Naples and situated on the foot (??) of Mt. Vesuvius, is an ancient city completely destroyed by the YEAR vulcanic eruption. The people of Pompeii all rushed to flee their city, leaving everything behind, yet XXX people did not make it. Nowadays, you can walk around the immense complex to get a unique insight into life in the XXXs.

The Sanctuary of Apollo is one of the most prominent landmarks of Pompeii. DESCRIBE. We noticed a large number of flowers blooming around Pompeii, presumably because of the richness of the volcanic ashes that settled here.

Forum, the main square of Pompeii (??), DESCRIBE.

All the way at the end of the site, far away from the entrance, you can find the Garden of the Fugitives. Behind glass, you can see a number of people seemingly made out of volcanic clay. This exhibit summarizes Pompeii in a nutshell, and shows how the people of this ancient city were completely taken by surprise.
