Over the year, we’ve taken numerous trips to places all around Australia. However, one big trip was still missing: a visit to Noosa and [Fraser Island](/sandy-adventures-on-fraser-island/). We started with a few days in Noosa, which has it all: beaches, shopping, bars and restaurants, and a National Park.

Noosa is a popular town on Australia’s Sunshine Coast, with good beaches, a great National Park, and plenty of shopping. Not surprisingly, it is popular among many Australians, young families and retirees in particular. In March, the weather is excellent, with temperatures about 30 degrees. Quite the difference compared to Melbourne, where the first signs of fall had arrived.

All action is centered on Hastings Street, the main street in Noosa. The street, one block from the ocean, is lined with hotels, shopping establishments, bars, and restaurants. Since we visited around the long Easter weekend, it was very busy, yet still relaxed.

If you want to get away from all the buzz on Hastings Street, Noosa National Park is located just a few minutes away. The park has numerous walking trails, one of which goes along the rugged coastline all the way to the empty beach of Alexandria Bay. If you’re not into hiking, it is possible to drive all the way up to Laguna Lookout for a spectacular view over Noosa. This town really has it all!
