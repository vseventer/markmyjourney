When it comes to Italy you will definitely not have any trouble finding great food,
whether you’re looking for a gourmet dinner or on the go pizza, you won’t be
disappointed. As most of our meals consisted of some sort of dough, pasta, or bread,
we found ourselves quite stuffed most of the time, but we always somehow
managed to find space for tiramisu.

## Prosciutto, salami, and mortadella
Prosciutto is the Italian version of dry-cured ham, while salami is a type of cured sausage that’s either beef or pork. Finally, mortadella is a finely ground cured pork. All are delicious and definitely worth a try, especially when in the Tuscan wine region, or Bologna in case of mortadella.

## Biscotti
Biscotti are hard cookies with almonds. They are quite crunchy and we liked dipping ours in our coffee, so they become a bit softer prior to eating.

## Bruschetta
Bruschetta is a perfect kind of appetizer or small dish to accompany a wine tasting. It’s basically toasted bread topped with a hefty dose of olive oil and chopped up tomatoes seasoned with garlic, basil, salt, and pepper.

## Buffalo mozzarella
There is mozzarella and then there is Buffalo mozzarella! When in [Naples]({{< ref "20170507-authentic-naples-and-ancient-pompeii.md" >}}), you will find Buffalo mozzarella everywhere, and at the airport you can even take a box home if you want. Buffalo mozzarella is gooey (softer and more watery) and has a nice strong flavor, a bit tangy even. You will never be satisfied with regular mozzarella again.

## Ribollita
This is possibly the best vegetable soup we have ever tasted. Perhaps it’s the
generous serving of olive oil, or the slow cooking process, either way this was a great start to our vertical wine tasting experience. The bread in the soup was a nice touch, to soak up the good wine that followed!

## Fried artichoke
Well, when we think of artichoke, we think artichoke-spinach dip. We were quite surprised to see fried artichoke, which in Italy apparently is the thing to try! The fried version tastes like a crispy vegetable. It was worth a try, but we do prefer the dip version most of the time.

## Pizza
Pizza is one of those things that you must try when you are in Italy, although this dish is readily available anywhere in the world, either gourmet style or as fast food. The dough can be thick or thin and topped with a vast variety of toppings.

## Lasagna
This layered dish uses flat-shaped pasta. Each layer contains a mixture of either meat and veggies with tomato sauce, or just veggies in tomato sauce, followed by a layer or béchamel and then pasta again.

## Truffle gnocchi
The smell of truffle can’t be missed. It’s one of the most prized items in a kitchen, and you only need a small amount to produce lots of flavors and smells. We love anything truffle, but an interesting combination that we tried in Rome was truffle with gnocchi (potato dumplings). Definitely a must try.

## Carbonara
Nothing beats a good carbonara. When in Rome, this is a must try. Carbonara is a pasta dish, where spaghetti or rigatoni are used in combination with egg yolk, pancetta (bacon), pepper, and cheese (Pecorino Romano). Contrary to the American versions, there is actually no cream used in the original carbonara recipe.

## Risotto
Risotto is a rice dish that’s quite tough to get right. The rice is usually cooked in wine, cream, butter, and vegetables like mushrooms and onion, or in our case: seafood. There are also other versions, like the Milanese which uses bone marrow, saffron, lard, and beef stock, or the version from Veneto where the ink-sacs of the cuttlefish are left on to produce a black risotto. Many versions exist, but risotto with the creamy mushroom is our personal favorite.

## Ravioli

## Limoncello and Spritz
Two perfect drinks. When visiting [Amalfi]({{< ref "20170507-capri-amalfi-coast.md" >}}), you will know from the gigantic lemons why Limoncello is such a popular drink. Limoncello is basically lemon liquer and quite delicious.

In the same region, Spritz is THE ultimate summer drink. It’s a mix of Aperol, prosecco, and soda water, decorated with a slice of organe. We preferred it to the Campari, which is more bitter and heavier.

## Cannoli
These Sicilian specialties are a must try when in Italy. They are tubular shaped fried pastry dough, filled with a creamy sweet ricotta. Make sure you get them from a bakery that only displays the shells, and fill them while you wait.

## Gelato
You can’t escape the Italian summer without trying gelato. Gelato is the Italian version of ice cream, but is quite different. For one, it’s churned at a much slower paste, making it way more dense than ice cream. Second, it uses less cream, more milk, and more sugar, making it a tad bit healthier then ice cream.

## Tiramisu
In our opinion tiramisu is the ultimate Italian dessert. We actually have attempted making this at home as well. Tiramisu is made with ladyfingers, dipped in a mixture of espresso and a dark alcohol, which is than layered with a mixture of egg yolks, mascarpone, whipped cream, coffee, and dusted with cocoa. The finished product must be left a few days to set to really get the right flavor.

## Panettone
Panettone is a type of sweet bread that is usually sprinkled with powdered sugar. As we were visiting Rome during the Christmas period, we were offered a lot of Panettone. It’s nice to try, but not really our thing.
