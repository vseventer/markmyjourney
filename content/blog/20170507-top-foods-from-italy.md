When it comes to Italy you will definitely not have any trouble finding great food,
whether you’re looking for a gourmet dinner or on the go pizza you won’t be
disappointed. As most of our meals consisted of some sort of dough, pasta or bread
we found ourselves quite stuffed most of the time, but we always somehow
managed to find space for tiramisu.

## Pizza
Pizza is one of those things that you must try when you are in Italy, although it is
readily available anywhere in the world either gourmet style or as fast food. The
dough can be thick or thin and topped with a vast variety of toppings.

## Prosciutto, Salami or Mortadella
Prosciutto is the Italian version of dry-cured ham, while salami is a type of cured
sausage that’s either beef or pork and mortadella a finely ground cured pork. All are
delicious and definitely worth a try especially in the Tuscan wine region, except for
mortadella, which everyone should try if in Bologna.

## Bruschetta
Bruschetta is a perfect kind of appetizer or small dish to accompany a wine tasting.
It’s basically toasted bread topped with a hefty dose of olive oil and chopped up
tomatoes seasoned with garlic, basil, salt and pepper.

## Soup**
This is possibly the best vegetable soup we have ever tasted. Perhaps it’s the
generous serving of olive oil or the slow cooking process, either way this was a great
start to our vertical wine tasting experience. The bread in the soup was a nice touch
and a good wine absorbent!

## Lasagna
This layered dish uses flat-shaped pasta. Each layer contains a mixture of either
meat and veggies with tomato sauce or just veggies in tomato sauce, followed by a
layer or béchamel and then pasta again.

## Truffle gnocchi
The smell of truffle can’t be missed. It’s one of the most prized items in a kitchen
and only a small amount can produce a lot of flavor and a strong smell. We love
anything truffle, but an interesting combination that we tried in Rome was with
gnocchi which are basically potato dumplings. Definitely a must try.

## Carbonara
Nothing beats a good Carbonara. When in Rome, this is a must try. This is basically a
pasta dish, where spaghetti or rigatoni are used in combination with egg yolk,
pancetta(bacon), pepper and cheese ( Pecorino Romano). Contrary to the American
versions there is actually no cream used in the original recipe.

## Risotto
Risotto is a rice dish that’s quite tough to get right. The rice is usually cooked in
wine, cream, butter and vegetables like mushrooms and onion or in our case
seafood. There are also other versions like the Milanese which uses bone marrow,
saffron, lard and beef stock or from Veneto where the ink-sacs of the cuttlefish are
left on to produce a black risotto. Many versions exist, but the one with the creamy
mushroom version is our personal favorite.

## Fried artichoke
Well when we think of artichoke we think artichoke-spinach dip, however we were
surprised to see that fried artichoke apparently is the thing to try! It’s basically
tastes like a crispy vegetable. It was worth a try, but we do prefer the dip version.

## Buffalo mozzarella
There is mozzarella and then there is Buffalo mozzarella!! When in Napoli you will
find Buffalo mozzarella everywhere and you can even take a box home if you want.
It’s gooey (softer and more watery) and has a nice strong flavor (a bit tangy). You
will never want normal mozzarella ever again.

## Limoncello and the Spritz
Two perfect drinks. When visiting the Amalfi region, you will know from the head-
sized lemons, why Limoncello is such a popular drink. Limoncello is basically lemon
liquer and quite delicious. The Spritz is THE ultimate summer drink. It’s basically
Aperol mixed with Prosecco and soda water and decorated with a organce slice. We
preferred it to the Campari, which is more bitter and heavier.

## Biscotti
Biscotti are basically hard cookies with almonds. They are quite crunchy and we
actually like dipping ours in our coffee.

## Cannoli
These Sicilian specialties are a must try when in Italy. They are tubular shaped
fried pastry dough that is filled with a creamy sweet ricotta filling. Make sure you
get them from a bakery that only displays the shells and fill them as you order
them.

## Gelato
You can’t escape the Italian summer without trying gelato. Gelato is basically the
Italian version of ice cream, but it is also quite different. For one it’s churned at a
much slower paste making it way more dense then ice-cream and also uses less
cream and more milk and sugar, making it low-fat (we can hope right? )….well
lower then ice-cream at least.

## Tiramisu
In our opinion this is the ultimate Italian dessert. We actually have attempted
making this at home as well. So basically ladyfingers are dipped in a mixture of
espresso and a dark alcohol, which is then layered with a mixture of egg yolks,
mascarpone, whipped cream and coffee and dusted with cocoa. The finished
product must be left a few days to really get the right flavor.

## Panettone
This is a type of sweet bread that is usually sprinkled with powdered sugar. As
we were visiting during the Christmas period, we were offered a lot of Panettone.
It’s nice to try, but not really our thing.
