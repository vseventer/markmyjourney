Liverpool, Manchester, and Leeds form the central corridor of England. On our way to the Lake District National Park and Scotland, we visited these three megacities, together home to over five million people. Further north, we visitied the largest city on the eastcoast: Newcastle, population 800,000.

## Liverpool
After a long drive in from London, we spent the night near Liverpool, and decided to explore the city the next morning. We started early, parked our car near the St. Johns Shopping Centre, and exited the parking lot towards the St. George’s Hall. This Neoclassical building houses concert halls and law courts.

We walked through the St. John’s Garden, alongside St. George’s Hall, towards the Central Library. We paused in the gardens for a minute, enjoying the view of the St. John’s Beacon radio and observation tower. The St. John’s Garden also contains the Hillsborough Monument Memorial, commemmorating the 96 people who died during the Hillsborough football tragedy in 1989.

The Central Library, with the World Museum on the west and Walker Art Gallery on the east, is another example of Neoclassical architecture in Liverpool. The libraries’ Picton Reading Room stands out because of its remarkable circular architecture.

Inside, the library is quite modern, with plenty of public computers, meeting rooms, and free Wi-Fi. The Picton Reading Room stands out yet again: inside you can find hundreds of old books, on three levels accessible only by wooden stairwell.

As mentioned above, the Walker Art Gallery is located just east of the library. This gallery is home to one of the largest art collections in the United Kingdom, exhibiting collections of paintings, drawings, sculptures, and decorative art. As most museums in Liverpool, there is no entrance fee.

After visiting the library, we moved on to the main sight of Liverpool: the Beatles, the famous English rockband from the 60s. Their first performances were held in the Cavern Club in Mathew Street in downtown Liverpool. Today, the Cavern Club still exists, and statues of all Beatles can be seen in Mathew Street.

Apart from the statue of John Lennon in Mathew Street, you can find countless statues all throughout Liverpool. One of the latest additions is the Fab Four statue at the Quayside, erected 50 years after the Beatles’ last show in Liverpool.

Apart from the statue, the Quayside is definitely worth the visit. It is home to a number of museums (Tate Liverpool, Maritime Museum, and Museum of Liverpool). Also, the Quayside docks serve as departing point for ferries to Isle of Man and Northern Ireland.
