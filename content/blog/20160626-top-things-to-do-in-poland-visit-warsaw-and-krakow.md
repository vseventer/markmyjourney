Poland surprised us in the sense that we didn't expect it to be as modern and big. Warsaw seems quite grand in comparison to its smaller neighboring countries capitals. Although Warsaw skyline was dominated by another Stalin birthday cake building (there is one in Riga too), the city itself is quite colorful. We started our walking tour in the picturesque square of X. The vastness of the squares, in combination with the colorful houses was a nice introduction to the beauty this city has to offer. From there, we walked through the courtyard of the palace, which interestingly is actually formed from three different building styles due to a disagreement in which style was the best between X and X. From there, we walked to a small residential area where the X wish bell is located. Legend has it that if you walk around the bell clockwise while holding on to it, your wishes will be granted. In that same square was also one of the smallest houses facade. When looking at the house, it appears to be incredibly narrow, however the back of the house is quite huge. Building your house this way was quite smart as it was the best way to avoid housing taxes back in the day as you only paid for the size of the facade.

## Warsaw
From this point we moved towards the main square, which is lined with restaurants and cafes. However, it is the armed mermaid statue that dominiates the center of the square. LEgend has it, that the mermaid set out to live among the people, however an evil businessman ?? ordered some men to capture her so that he could keep her for himself. One of the capturers couldn't resist but listeneing to her sing, and fell in love with her, vowing to protect her. He also brought the mermaid some weapons to defend herself with and in exchange she promised to pretect the city of Warsaw.

From the lovely square we moved towards the strategically built castle walls. COntinuing on we passed a museum dedicated to Marie Currie, a world class scientist who won two noble prices in different fields. From there, we continued on to the hold Jewish quarter passing the X monument commoderating the X before looping back to the center via X street. Along the way we came across a bench that plays music, the music of the famed Polish pianist X. Another highlight of this city is X park. Not only is it the biggest park in Poland, it also hosts a variety of events.

The following day we took a four hour bus to the second biggest city and former capital: Krakow.

## Krakow
Krakow has an old world kind of charm, and feels quite different then Warsaw. It's also quite a beautiful city with a park running along the outer parts of the old city. Unlike Warsaw, which was completely bombed during Nazi occupation, Krakow remained in tact as Germans liked the city. We started out our walk next to the castle walls, which were actually ordered by X to be taken down but thanks to the arguments presented by X that tearing down the wall would cause a Marley Monroe effect on the women of the city attending mass, the breakdown of the wall was overturned. From there, we made our way to the vast main square, where you can see the two uneven towers of X church. Each hour, you can hear a trumpet played form one of the towers, signifying XX. The story goes that two brothers competed against each other to build each tower, and as one of the brothers finished his building much faster the other brother killed him with a knife out of jealousy. However, he regretted his action so much that before completing his tower he jumped off committing suicide.

From the square we walked to wards the castle, along the way we saw the popes window, where the much beloved pope often had convesations with the people through his bedroom window. After a bit of an uphill walk, we passed the entry to the castle complex. The first thing you can see is a statue of X, who was the first European to climb the highest mountain in Australia, and consequently named the mountain to XX. Across from that, you have a view of what was Schindlers House. XXXX

Continuing up we passed the carhedral, which of course has a legend of its own. You can see an XX hanging from the cathedral doors, which signifies the dragon. According to the legend,

Lastly, we moved from the cathedral to the courtyard of X building, which is built in X style. Nowadays, it is mainly used for X.
