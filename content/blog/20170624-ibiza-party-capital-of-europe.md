In Europe, the best place to go partying is in Ibiza, Spain. Even though we are no frequent visitors to nightclubs, we simply couldn’t go without visiting one of the islands’ famous clubs. Typically, clubs open their door at midnight, and party the night away until it gets light again. For us, this left plenty of time during the day to explore numerous beaches located on the southern half of the island.

The island of Ibiza is home to around 130,000 people, mostly living in either Ibiza Town on the east, or San Antonio on the west. During our stay, we were based near Ibiza Town, at Platja d’en Bossa. As we had the whole day to explore the island, we decided to rent a car on the spot (expect to pay around 40 euros a day), and go on a little road trip visiting seven highly rated beaches.

## Platja d’en Bossa
Platja d’en Bossa, only five minutes away from our accommodation, is one of the more popular beaches in Ibiza. It is lined with resorts, and also home to three major clubs: Bora Bora, Space, and Ushuaia. We found the crowd at this beach is mainly there for drinking and partying, and we were quickly on our way to our next destination.

## Cala Bassa
Cala Bassa, best reached by bus or car, is located only 15 minutes south of San Antonio. As it is well connected to the city, expect a busy but beautiful beach. A little bit higher up the beach, you can find the Cala Bassa Beach Club, serving food and cold drinks. If you park at their parking lot, you can redeem the five euro parking fee for a cold beer.

As you enter the beach, you will notice a few rock pools on the eastern side of the beach. If you don’t feel like sunbathing all day, you can go for a refreshing dive into one of the rock pools. Also, as with any beach in Ibiza, expect a large number of private boats anchored in the bay just off the beach.

## Cala Comte
Twenty minutes further south you can find the picturesque Cala Comte. We merely stopped here for a picture, as the beach itself was way too crowded. The view of the Escull de Ses Punxes island just off Cala Comte is fantastic, and also causes the water to be relatively calm. There is no public transportation to Cala Comte, so a moped or rental car (or expensive taxi ride) is necessary.

## Cala Vadella
Cala Vadella: our favorite beach in Ibiza. This hidden gem can be found at the end of a windy road connecting Cala Comte with Cala d’Hort. This quiet beach, popular among families, is protected by the Es Torraci headland, so the water is extremely clear and calm.

You won’t find too many tourists at this beach, and therefore food, drinks, and entertainment is still relatively affordable. Expect to pay around €30 for a sun lounger and umbrella, and around €8 for a (delicious) cocktail. The beach itself has fine sand that gradually disappears into the shallow sea, making it the perfect place to relax, sleep, and swim.

On your way in or out of Cala Vadella, make sure to stop at the viewpoint at the Es Torraci headland. Here, you have a perfect view over the bay, the beach, and mountains. We only stayed at Cala Vadella for an hour or two, but if anywhere, we would have no problem spending the entire day relaxing at this beach.

## Cala d’Hort
One of the more well-known beaches is Cala d’Hort, thanks to its view over the uninhabited rocky island of Es Vedra. Especially at sunset, this place is magical. Unfortunately, as most beaches, it is best to have your own transport in order to reach to Cala d’Hort.

## Cala Jondal
We had high hopes of Cala Jondal, as it is home to as many as five restaurants, yet we were disappointed. As the beach is not protected against the elements, there is a lot of debris (seaweed, trash, etc.) floating around. So much so, that there is a bridge into the water allowing you to walk over the debris washed ashore. Suffice it to say, we didn’t go for a swim here, and instead tried the paella at one of the restaurants.

## Sa Caleta
At this point, we almost completed our road trip along the southern shore of Ibiza. As the sun began to set, we had one beach left: Sa Caleta. This beach, only a stones’ throw from the airport, is a bit different than all the other beaches we visited earlier. The entrance to the beach is a simple wooden walkway, taking you down the beach protected by a rock wall of around 10 meters high.

Contrary to most other beaches, there were only a handful of visitors, mostly locals. The setting sun made for a brilliant reflection on the rock wall, and we went for a refreshing sunset swim. Sa Caleta is only a small beach, but definitely scenic and worth a visit.

## Amnesia
After arriving back in Platja d’en Bossa, we went for a quick nap, before getting ready for our night out at Amnesia. Luckily, we still had our car, allowing us to drive the fifteen minutes ourselves rather than taking the party bus. We arrived around 1AM, skipped the line thanks to our pre-bought tickets, and entered the nightclub. Despite the time, we were still one of the earlier visitors, and it didn’t get too busy until around 2:30AM.

Amnesia consists of two main rooms, both playing different music, although in our case both rooms boosted mainly techno. Despite not being on our usual playlist, we enjoyed ourselves, and had a great night out. We do highly recommend to have a few drinks before though, as buying refreshments at the nightclub is extremely expensive (€9 for water, €18 for spirits, and €32 for cocktails). All in all, it was a good experience, but we can’t imagine spending a whole week here going from club to club spending a ridiculous amount of money on tickets and overpriced drinks.

## Ibiza Town
After sleeping in the next morning, we spent the afternoon exploring Ibiza Town before flying back to London. Ibiza Town, the most populated city on the island, is littered with restaurants, small supermarkets, and souvenir shops. A little bit away from the waterfront you can find restaurants serving locals typical Spanish tapas.

Towards the waterfront, you can find dozens of souvenir shops, ice cream and frozen yogurt shops, and restaurants geared towards tourists. We strolled along the harbor, admiring the many yachts, before turning around and heading to the Castle of Ibiza.

{{< photo "IMG_5460.JPG" >}}

The Castle of Ibiza rises high above the rest of Ibiza Town. We visited its main gate, Portal de ses Taules. Inside the castle grounds, you will find mostly houses, although the walk along the wall is quite worth it. We decided not to climb the wall though, as it was extremely hot out, and we had to catch our bus taking us back to the airport.
