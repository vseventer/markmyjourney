We found that not only did Bolivia have multiple ways of preparing potatoes, it also had a vast variety of them. Although quinoa was also a popular staple, the most common dish was potato combined with chicken. We found that the spices used were more minimal than in neighboring countries, however still well prepared. The abundance of fresh juices was refreshing, and at the same time nutricious.

We were pleasantly surprised with the Bolivian chocolate, even though it was bit tough to bite into, the taste was quite complex and smooth. Other desserts we bought at the supermarket, however, were very disappointing. The lemon pie we got at a bakery in La Paz was fresh and delicious, so we recommend getting your deserts fresh.

* The best: **Lemon Pie**,
* The worst: **supermarket bought desserts** and **banana-flour dessert**,
* The healthiest: the fresh **juices** served with almost every meal.
