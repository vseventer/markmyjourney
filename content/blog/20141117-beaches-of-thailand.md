After spending 10 days in the north of Thailand, we headed south in search for white sand beaches. From Chiang Mai, we took an overnight bus to Bangkok, followed by an overnight train to Surat Thani. From there, a three hour bus ride brought us to Krabi Town. Needless to say, we smelled terrible, so a nice long shower and nap was the first thing we did.

Krabi itself has not that much to offer, yet it is a great starting point for exploring the islands located in the Andaman Sea. Ao Nang beach was a mere 20-minute taxi ride away, while Koh Lanta took three hours to reach by minivan. We also went on a tour to Khao Phing Kan (better known as James Bond Island), where the “The Man With The Golden Gun” (1974) was filmed. As with almost all islands, tourists nowadays overpopulate the places, making it hard to find a nice and quiet beach.

Now, after almost three weeks in Thailand, we feel we have a good impression of how life is here. Therefore, it is time to move on. Since our flight to Cambodia isn’t until the 27th, we figured why not spend the next 10 days in Malaysia and Singapore?
