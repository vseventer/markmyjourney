Only a week after visiting [Ibiza]({{< ref "20170624-ibiza-party-capital-of-europe.md" >}}), we were back on the plane towards yet another Mediterranean island: Malta. This island is often described as the “New Ibiza”, thanks to its pool and daytime parties. We, however, were in Malta to discover its culture, history, beaches, and caves.

Malta consists of three islands: the island of Malta, the main and largest island in the southeast, Gozo in the northwest, and Kemmuna in between. We started our trip by visiting Kemmuna, before heading back to the main island. Now, in total, Malta is still very small: it only takes one hour to drive from one side of the island to the other, and that’s due to the outdated roads, as the distance is only 40 kilometers.

## Kemmuna
The small island of Kemmuna can be reached by taking a ferry from Cirkewwa port on the main island. Although the island is small, it is home to one of the most popular tourist attractions: the Blue Lagoon. We, of course, wanted to see the light blue colors of this beach with our own eyes. For 10 euros per person, we boarded a small speedboat and set off on a rough 15-minute journey.

Once we arrived, however, we quickly found the Blue Lagoon was overrun with tourists. As there is no real beach (just rock), the place was crammed, with little space to relax. There is another beach on Kemmuna, Santa Maria, which is more quiet. We decided to head back to the main island to visit some of its more local beaches.

On the way back, the ferry took a detour along the Santa Maria Caves. Most of its caves are underwater, making it a popular dive site, but the view of the cliffs from above water are definitely worth it too!

## Island of Malta
Most of the tourist sights are located on the island of Malta, like the ghost town of Mdina, a number of old archeological sites, and Valletta, the capital. Most of the islands’ coastline consists of cliffs and rock, yet there are a handful of decent beaches as well.

Our first stop was at the Blue Grotto, a cave on the southern end of the island. The cave is famous for its crystal blue water, thanks to light reflections of the sun. On calm days, you can take a small boat into the caves to see this for yourself. Unfortunately, during our visit, high waves made it impossible for the locals to take their boats out. Instead, we had to settle for a picture from the viewpoint.

We quickly moved on, towards Għar Lapsi, a small bay protected by rocks. This bay is a bit out of the way, and therefore very popular among locals. There is no sandy beach, however, and very little space to relax outside of the water, although the large rocks do provide plenty of protection from the sun.

Further north, near the town of Mellieha, you can find the largest beach on Malta: Għadira Bay Beach. Most of the beach is taken over by vendors selling sun loungers and umbrellas, yet there still is plenty of space left over. We were looking for a slightly smaller and calmer beach, so we kept looking.

Our favorite beach was Golden Bay Beach, located on the other side of the island. Surrounded by a few hotels and restaurants, the water is calm, and the sand gradually disappears in the water. A great place to spend an afternoon laying around, sipping on a beer or two.

Only two minutes away, just around the corner, you can find Għajn Tuffieħa Bay Beach, a beach with only one (mediocre) restaurant. The beach is a bit smaller than Golden Bay Beach, but very nice and reasonably clean (unlike some of the other beaches we visited) as well.

On the easternmost tip of Malta, surrounded by cliffs, you can find the popular St. Peter’s Pool, a stunning natural swimming pool. Despite lacking an actual beach, the scenery of St. Peter’s Pool is unbeatable. The pools are a bit out of the way (30 minutes by car from Valletta), but we highly recommend going for a swim here!

## Mdina
Over the centuries, Malta was ruled by the Arabs, Romans, Spanish, and a few other civilizations. Until the 16th century, Mdina served as the capital of Malta, before a religious order moved the administration to Birgu, near Valletta. Ever since then, entering Mdina is like stepping back in time, as the walled city is near uninhabited. Here, you can definitely see how the influence of different cultures shaped Malta.

Apart from the few residents, the majority of the people in Mdina are tourists. You can go for a ride in a horse cart, or simply stroll around the small walled city. We entered from the Mdina Gate, and headed towards the Mdina Cathedral, the cities’ main sight.

For a small fee (5 euro), you can enter both the Mdina Cathedral and Cathedral Museum. The cathedral was built in late 17th century, replacing a medieval chapel built five centuries earlier. To this day, the cathedral is still home to the Maltese Christian following.

Given the weather, we opted to continue our walk, and stopped at one of the few restaurants selling refreshments. After getting a delicious ice cream, we sat down for a few minutes, enjoying the purple flowers, golden stones, and quietness of Mdina.

## Valletta
We ended our trip to Malta with a visit to Valletta, the capital. We entered the inner city through the City Gate, and spend a good two hours strolling through the city center. From the City Gate, you can walk all the way along the main street towards Fort St. Elmo. On the way, you will pass the St. John’s Cathedral, St George’s Square, and many shops and restaurants.

On the south side of Valletta you can find the Upper Barrakka Gardens. This impressive public garden has great views over the Saluting Battery and Grand Harbour. The battery is one of the most popular wedding venues in Malta, and while pricy, the views definitely are worth it.

We ended our visit to Malta at the Valletta Waterfront. This area, only a few minutes’ drive out of the city center, comes to live every evening, with a dozen restaurants serving delicious meals. We had a fantastic grilled seabass here, for a reasonable price. However, for Maltese standards, this area is quite up-scale, judging from the general public.
