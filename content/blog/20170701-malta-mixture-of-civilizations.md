Only a week after visiting [Ibiza]({{< ref "20170624-ibiza-party-capital-of-europe.md" >}}), we were back on the plane towards yet another Mediterranean island: Malta. This island is often described as the “New Ibiza”, thanks to its pool and daytime parties. We, however, were in Malta to discover its culture, history, beaches, and caves.

## Mdina
Over the centuries, Malta was ruled by the Arabs, Romans, Spanish, and a few other civilizations. Until the 16th century, Mdina served as the capital of Malta, before a religious order moved the administration to Birgu, near Valletta. Ever since then, entering Mdina is like stepping back in time, as the walled city is near uninhabited.
