Meteora is a unique this UNESCO World Heritage Site. Located in the center of the Greek mainland it is roughly three hours away by car from Thessaloniki and four hours from Athens. Meteora consists of six dispersed monasteries perched on top of jagged cliffs, which make for an incredible sight. The monasteries were built by monks back in the 14th century, and have been beautifully maintained.

Our journey started in Athens, from where we picked up our rental car and drove north to Kalampáka. Driving in Greece is quite the experience, but we found out that, as long as you let the speeding locals pass by moving to the shoulder, you’ll be fine. We arrived in Kalampáka before nightfall, allowing us to shortly visit the town center. Apart from the main street and Riga Fereou Square, there is not much to see and do, as most tourists are here for one thing only: Meteora.

The next morning, we headed to Meteora. The best way to explore the surroundings and monasteries is by simply driving around. We opted to visit the Great Monastery first, and then made our way southeast from there. Be sure to stop at the various viewpoints along the way, as the scenery is spectacular.

There is plenty of parking around the monasteries, although in summer you might have to wait a little bit for a spot to open up. Most monasteries cost three euros to enter and are open six days a week. Be ready for a lot of stairs though.

The Great Monastery is the largest and oldest monastery of Meteora, built in the 14th century. The decorations and courtyard inside the monastery are quite charming and definitely worth a visit. If you are lucky you might see a monk make his way to the monastery using the lift.

After our short visit, we decided to start heading towards the other five remaining monasteries. From the Great Monastery, you have great views over the Varlaam, the second largest monastery.

From Varlaam, on the way to the Monastery of the Holy Trinity, you will pass an observation deck. From here, you have great panoramic views over all of Meteora. Snap a quick picture, or just enjoy the view.

The Monastery of the Holy Trinity is located closest to Kalampáka, and can be reached on foot by crossing a series of bridges. Yet, this sounds easier than it is, as the monastery is situated 400 meters above ground.

The last monastery we visited was Agios Stefanos, isolated on the southeast corner of Meteora. From here, it is an easy ride back down to ground level and Kalampáka. If you plan on visiting only one or two monasteries, we highly recommend renting a car instead of an organized tour. We spent a good five to six hours in Meteora, and felt we got a good impression of this incredible place.
