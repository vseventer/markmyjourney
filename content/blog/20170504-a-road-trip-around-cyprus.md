The island of Cyprus is the third-largest and most populous island in the Mediterranean. It is located only a few hours off the coast of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt. The northern part of the island is Turkish, while the southern part forms the Republic of Cyprus. We spent a few days touring the south; exploring its archeological sites, rugged wine region, archeological sites, and cities.

## Ayia Napa
Departing from [Athens]({{< ref "20170423-ancient-greece-in-delphi-and-athens.md#athens" >}}), our trip started at Larnaca International Airport. After picking up our rental car, we headed east, towards Ayia Napa, a resort town welcoming thousands of (dominantly British) tourists every year. The town almost solely consists of bars, restaurants, and clubs, and comes alive at night. During the day, most tourists relax in their hotels, or on the beach.

The closest beach to Ayia Napa is Nissi Beach. This 500-meter wide beach has extremely clear water, and with the cape protecting the bay and beach from the elements make it a popular place to go for a swim. In summer, be prepared to share the beach with hundreds of other tourists. Luckily, there is a small shack near the parking lot selling refreshments and fast food.

If you prefer to avoid the crowds, the Blue Lagoon near Cape Greco (the southeastern tip of Cyprus) might be of interest. This is not really a beach, but more like a rocky terrain from where you can jump into the sea. Many boats also anchor in the bay, and often you will find people snorkel or dive. No wonder, since the area is full of caves due to the rocky terrain.

Just a short drive north, you can find Konnos Beach. This beach is wildly popular place among locals, as only a few tourists are able to locate the somewhat hidden entrance. From the hillside parking lot, a short walk down the hill will bring you to the beach. Like Nissi Beach, Konnos Beach is protected by a bay, making it a great place to swim.

The last beach we would visit that day was the beautiful Fig Tree Bay Beach, located in Protaras. Its fine sand and crystal-clear water make for a great swim, or alternatively you can rent a glass floor boat to explore the sealife a bit further off shore.

Back in the day, the entire coastline around Fig Tree Bay consisted of reef. Today, just off the southern tip of the beach, you can still find some remaining reef. This small area is a popular place to snorkel, although the water is so clear that the reef is visible from the beach as well.

After all the swimming we were getting hungry, and decided to go for a quick meal in Protaras. Contrary to Ayia Napa, which mostly caters towards Brits, Protaras welcomes mostly Russians. Personally, we found Protaras a bit more upscale, as well as slightly cheaper (especially alcohol).

## Paphos
The next morning, after visiting so many beaches, we were ready to explore the inlands of Cyprus, as well as Paphos, a seaside city on the western end of Cyprus famous for its archeological sites. From the main highway, we took an inland road leading towards the Troodos Mountains, the mountain range covering the center of the island. We stopped at the Karseras Family Winery to taste a few of the islandsâ€™ Commandarias (sweet dessert wines).

We left the mountains behind us, and headed back towards the coast. Our destination was two miles north of Paphos, at the archeological site of the Tombs of the Kings. As the name suggests, this site was a burial ground, and many high officials and aristocrats (the upper class) are buried here.

Apart from the Tombs of the Kings, the city of Paphos has a few more archeological highlights, like its Castle of Paphos. This fort, built by the Byzantines, was used to protect the harbor. Over the years, it was rebuilt after an earthquake, as well as strenghtened by the Ottoman empire. In more recent history, the castle has been a prison, warehouse, before being turned into a museum.

Before leaving Paphos and heading to Limassol, we decided to go for a stroll along the boulevard of Paphos. Here, you will find plenty of restaurants, fast food, and ice cream to satisfy your cravings.
