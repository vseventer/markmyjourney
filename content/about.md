In 2014 we left the United States for a seven month adventure throughout Asia and South America. Afterwards, we lived Down Under for a year in Melbourne, exploring the Pacific. Currently, we are backpacking around Europe, and eventually planning to settle in London. Beyond that? The possibilities are endless.
