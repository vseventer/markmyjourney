Getting stuck in Rio de Janeiro after our flight got diverted had one advantage: the hotel had an awesome buffet which gave us an impression of what the Brazilians like to have on the table. This post contains a selection of the typical Brazilian foods we found all over the place.

Brazil offered a great variety of foods. Most breakfasts offer ham and cheese sandwiches as well as various cakes and drinks, not only limited to coffee, but also fresh juices. The passion fruit and coconut cake were quite delicious while the Brigadeiros and Beijinho de Cocos were too sweet. For a quick snack Brazilians prefer Pão de Queijos. We enjoyed most of the main dishes, even the cassava flour.

* The best: **Açaí**,
* The worst: **Beijinho de Coco**,
* The healthiest: **Açaí**.
