Amsterdam is only a 20-minute drive, or 60-minute public transport trip away from Mijdrecht. So, as good tourists are ought to do, we visited the capital of the Netherlands. To be a tourist, but also to catch up with friends, and to party.

Apart from all the typical spots (Museumplein, Leidseplein, the various museums), we walked towards the Jordaan neighborhood. As Mark lived there for a few weeks taking care of a cat while the owners were on holiday, we walked around some spots he particularly liked. This gave a nice twist to an otherwise very touristy day.
