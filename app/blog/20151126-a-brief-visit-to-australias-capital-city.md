Most people think the capital of Australia is either Sydney or Melbourne. Yet, it is Canberra, which is located between the two. It is not the most eventful city in Australia, yet worth a short visit. We decided to make the six-hour drive from Melbourne, which was a bit more tiring then we anticipated. Most of the surroundings on the way were hills, and that gets boring after a while.

Canberra’s CBD is pretty concentrated and could be easily explored in a short amount of time. A bit more north, the Braddon neighborhood lined with restaurants had a bit more character. The waterfront, even though simple, was quite peaceful with great views of the lake separating the CBD from all the embassies in Capital Hill. Driving through Embassy road, we passed many extravagant embassy buildings, making it clear that Canberra really is the Australian capital.
