From [La Paz](/blog/la-paz-the-worlds-highest-capital-city.html) our next destination was Cusco, Peru. The best way to get there is by taking a bus with stopover in Copacabana, a small town near Lake Titicaca, worldâ€™s highest navigable lake. We almost did not make it out of La Paz as the local people in El Alto, just north of La Paz, were demonstrating by putting up road blocks. Luckily, we left La Paz just in time as we could still make it around the initial road blocks, otherwise we would have been forced to remain in La Paz for a few more days as protests tend to take quite a while.

After a few hours we arrived in Copacabana, a small tourist town mainly used as starting point for tours to Isla del Sol, an island in Lake Titicaca. Once on the island, we hiked for an hour to the town of Yumani, where the boat brought us back to Copacabana. All in all, the quick stop in Copacabana for Lake Titicaca turned out to be a perfect stop between long bus rides on our way to Peru.

The border with Peru is only situated fifteen minutes outside of Copacabana. A large section of Lake Titicaca is part of Peru, but we found that a short excursion to one of the islands is more than enough to experience what this lake is all about. For us, Cusco was our next stop.
