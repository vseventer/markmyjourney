<p>We woke up early, still tired from exploring <a href=https://www.markmyjourney.com/one-week-in-albania-the-north/ >the north</a>.

<h2 id=berat>Berat</h2>
<p>About two hours after leaving Tirana we arrived in Berat. Our first stop was Berat Castle, dating back from the 13th century. The premise is home to a number of small churches, as the population of the fortress was mostly Christian.</p>

</div><p></p>
<p>From the castle, you can take an extremely steep road down to the town of Berat. This town is definitely worth visiting, mainly because of the architecture: all houses are white with red roofs. With the castle on the hill in the background, it makes for a picturesque spot.</p>

<h2 id=çorovodë>Çorovodë</h2>
<p>Our next stop was just past the town of Çorovodë. Here, over the centuries, the Osum River cut a 900-metre deep canyon. The near-vertical cliffs on both sides of the river are simply incredible. If you feel adventurous you can also spend the day white-water rafting through the canyon.</p>

<p>From Çorovodë, the plan was to drive to Gjirokastër. The shortest route is through Fir of Hotova National Park, a mountainous area with few inhabitants. Unfortunately, the GPS directed us to what seemed a never-ending rollercoaster of unpaved trails and gravel roads. It offered untamed beautiful scenery, but it definitely required a powerful vehicle and an adventurous spirit to go along with it. Along the way, we encountered a few jeeps that did this for fun. After a bouncy two-hour ride, we finally touched solid ground, and off we went to Gjirokastër.</p>
<h2 id=gjirokastër>Gjirokastër</h2>
<p>Gjirokastër is a city very similar to Berat: on the hill you can find the Gjirokastër Castle, while the houses are, again, white with red roofs. The town does have more of a center though, its old town is even a UNESCO World Heritage Site, because of its preserved buildings from Ottoman times.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Due to its close proximity to Greece, the town historically had a large Greek minority. In 1912, the local Greek population even declared Gjirokastër area an autonomous republic, before becoming part of Albania again in 1914.</p>

<h2 id=blue-eye>Blue Eye</h2>
<p>As the sun was close to setting, we were close to our final destination. Yet, we had one more stop to make: the Blue Eye. This water spring is a popular tourist attraction, and a good spot to cool down.</p>
